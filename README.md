This is a collection of Arduino sketches.

2024 July 5, Traffic Light: At the moment, I have three lights blinking, blinky x3. I will adapt this to a traffic ligth, and them maybe add a delay differential equation to figure out the optimal timing for the light.

2024 July 6: I've added trafficLight.c for debugging becaues Arduino files cannot be debugged. The mockup works and uses a delay.
